Course for learning UAVs fundamentals for fixed-wing and multirotor UAVs. Involves creating MATLAB programs and simulations for fixed-wing and multirotor propellers, calculating performance, and creating performace charts. Involves Simulink modelling for multirotor and fixed-wing UAVs.  

## AER1217 - Development of Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

Course for learning multirotor UAV software algorithms. Involves doing multiple laboratory projects that build into a quadrotor racing final project. Final project includes developing a RRT* based algorithm to pass through gates and avoid obstacles, testing on a PyBullet drone simulator, and testing on Crazyflie drones in real life. Laboratories include programming drones to fly to waypoints and flying in circular trajectories in a PyBullet drone simulator, vision-based landmark state estimation from drones using OpenCV algorithms, and visual odometry based localization of a cyclist's trajectory using scalar based point cloud alignment techniques, RANSAC, and OpenCV feature detectors. Majority of the programming is in Python.

## AER1513 - State Estimation for Aerospace Vehicles

An in depth course on state-of-the-art state estimation techniques for robots. Course involves doing three in depth laboratories on different state estimation scenarios. The first scenario is a 1D state estimation problem, determining the distance a mobile robot is from a wall, being solved using linear batch state estimation. The second problem is a 2D state estimation problem, determining the position of a mobile robot on flat ground using obstacles as visible landmarks, solved by using an extended Kalman filter. The third problem is a 3D state estimation problem, determining the position of a hand-held stereo camera in 3D observing landmarks on the ground, solved by using full-batch nonlinear estimation techniques. Programming uses a combination of MATLAB and Python. 

## AER1515 - Perception for Robotics

A broad course on state-of-the-art perception techniques for robotics. The course involves doing three assignments on robotic perception algorithms and doing a robotic perception final project. The first assignment involved creating an animal face classification convolutional neural network. The second assignment involved using feature detection and matching algorithms from OpenCV, and aligning point clouds using iterated closest point (ICP) algorithm. The third assignment uses the KITTI dataset to perform depth estimation, using YOLO for object detection in order to do segmentation. The final project uses aerial images from drones and the goal is to segment the images into different landmark types. State-of-the-art segmentation networks like DeepLabV3 is used to perfrom segmentation. The purpose of the project is to implement the algorithm on drones in order to for the drones to plant tree seeds in optimal areas for growth. Programming is in Python.

## AER1516 - Robot Motion Planning

A course on robot motion planning algorithms. The course consists of two programming assignments and a final project. The first programming assignment uses Dubins path to implement an RRT* path planner for robots. The second assignment uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to perform state estimation of a mobile robot travelling in a figure eight. The final project involves training a drone in a Unity based simulator AirSim to avoid obstacles in a simulation environment using state-of-the-art reinforcement techniques including using Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), policy gradients, and the TD3 algorithm. Programming is done in Python.

## APS360 - Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

A course on machine learning fundamentals. Content includes doing many labs on artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Gesture recognition and spam detection are example labs. Final project involved using an ANN to analyze hockey statistics to create NHL draft rankings based on data from previous years. Programming is done in Python, using PyTorch for machine learning.

## Capstone - Drone Capstone Project

A capstone project in a group of 4 to build and design a drone from scratch to perform several tasks critical from nuclear safety inspections. Tasks in order are building the drone, making the drone hover in place 1m from the ground, making the drone travel to waypoints, and to autonomously avoid coloured obstacles by turning in certain directions. Drone is equipped with a computer vision object detection algorithm (YoloV5), visual SLAM for accurate localization using visual inertial odometry (VIO) and trajectory rollout based RRT* motion planning. Projects involves heavy use of ROSPy and ROSCPP, RViz and Gazebo for drone simulation, and code written in Python and C++ programming languages.

## CSC412 - Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning

The first assignment is about decision theory and a naive Bayes generative model for fashion MNIST dataset. The second assignment is about image denoising using the Loopy BP algorithm and Markov chain Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in the TrueSkill model. The third assignment is about Stochastic Variational Inference in the TrueSkill model and training a variational autoencoder (VAE) on synthetic data.
