# Courses and Course Projects

## AER1216 - Fundamentals of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

Course for learning UAVs fundamentals for fixed-wing and multirotor UAVs. Involves creating MATLAB programs and simulations for fixed-wing and multirotor propellers, calculating performance, and creating performace charts. Involves Simulink modelling for multirotor and fixed-wing UAVs.  

## AER1217 - Development of Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

Course for learning multirotor UAV software algorithms. Involves doing multiple laboratory projects that build into a quadrotor racing final project. Final project includes developing a RRT* based algorithm to pass through gates and avoid obstacles, testing on a PyBullet drone simulator, and testing on Crazyflie drones in real life. Laboratories include programming drones to fly to waypoints and flying in circular trajectories in a PyBullet drone simulator, vision-based landmark state estimation from drones using OpenCV algorithms, and visual odometry based localization of a cyclist's trajectory using scalar based point cloud alignment techniques, RANSAC, and OpenCV feature detectors.
