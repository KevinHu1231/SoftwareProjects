Graph Attention Networks"],"metadata":{"id":"mKHEyXp1EVdo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lx15HdotKnt_"},"source":["## Graph attention layer (Your task)\n","A GAT is made up of multiple such layers. In this section, you will implement a single graph attention layer. Similar to the `GraphConvolution()`, this `GraphAttentionLayer()` module takes $\\mathbf{h} = \\{ \\overrightarrow{h_1}, \\overrightarrow{h_2}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{h_N} \\}$ where $\\overrightarrow{h_i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^F$ as input and outputs $\\mathbf{h'} = \\{ \\overrightarrow{h'_1}, \\overrightarrow{h'_2}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{h'_N} \\}$, where $\\overrightarrow{h'_i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F'}$. However, instead of weighing each neighbouring node based on the adjacency matrix, we will use self attention to learn the relative importance of each neighbouring node. Recall from HW4 where you are asked to write out the equation for single headed attention, here we will implement multi-headed attention, which involves the following steps: \n","\n","\n","### The initial transformation\n","In GCN above, you have completed similar transformation. But here, we need to define a weight matrix and perform this transformation for each head: $\\overrightarrow{s^k_i} = \\mathbf{W}^k \\overrightarrow{h_i}$. We will perform a single linear transformation and then split it up for each head later. Note the input $\\overrightarrow{h}$ has shape `[n_nodes, in_features]` and $\\overrightarrow{s}$ has shape of `[n_nodes, n_heads * n_hidden]`. Remember to reshape $\\overrightarrow{s}$ has shape of `[n_nodes, n_heads, n_hidden]` for later uses. Note: set `bias=False` for this linear transformation. \n","\n","### attention score\n","We calculate these for each head $k$. Here for simplicity of the notation, we omit $k$ in the following equations. The attention scores are defined as the follows: \n","$$e_{ij} = a(\\mathbf{W} \\overrightarrow{h_i}, \\mathbf{W} \\overrightarrow{h_j}) =a(\\overrightarrow{s_i}, \\overrightarrow{s_j})$$, \n","where $e_{ij}$ is the attention score (importance) of node $j$ to node $i$.\n","We will have to calculate this for each head. $a$ is the attention mechanism, that calculates the attention score. The paper concatenates $\\overrightarrow{s_i}$, $\\overrightarrow{s_j}$ and does a linear transformation with a weight vector $\\mathbf{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 F'}$ followed by a $\\text{LeakyReLU}$. $$e_{ij} = \\text{LeakyReLU} \\Big(\n","\\mathbf{a}^\\top \\Big[ \\overrightarrow{s_i} \\Vert \\overrightarrow{s_j}  \\Big] \\Big)$$\n","\n","#### How to vectorize this? Some hints: \n","1. `tensor.repeat()` gives you $\\{\\overrightarrow{s_1}, \\overrightarrow{s_2}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{s_N}, \\overrightarrow{s_1}, \\overrightarrow{s_2}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{s_N}, ...\\}$.\n","\n","2. `tensor.repeat_interleave()` gives you\n","$\\{\\overrightarrow{s_1}, \\overrightarrow{s_1}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{s_1}, \\overrightarrow{s_2}, \\overrightarrow{s_2}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{s_2}, ...\\}$.\n","\n","3. concatenate to get $\\Big[\\overrightarrow{s_i} \\Vert \\overrightarrow{s_j} \\Big]$ for all pairs of $i, j$. Reshape $\\overrightarrow{s_i} \\Vert \\overrightarrow{s_j}$ has shape of `[n_nodes, n_nodes, n_heads, 2 * n_hidden]`\n","\n","4. apply the attention layer and non-linear activation function to get $e_{ij} = \\text{LeakyReLU} \\Big( \\mathbf{a}^\\top \\Big[ \\overrightarrow{s_i} \\Vert \\overrightarrow{s_j}  \\Big] \\Big)$, where $\\mathbf{a}^\\top$ is a single linear transformation that maps from dimension `n_hidden * 2` to `1`. Note: set the `bias=False` for this linear transformation. $\\mathbf{e}$ is of shape `[n_nodes, n_nodes, n_heads, 1]`. Remove the last dimension `1` using `squeeze()`. \n","\n","\n","#### Perform softmax \n","First, we need to mask $e_{ij}$ based on adjacency matrix. We only need to sum over the neighbouring nodes for the attention calculation. Set the elements in $e_{ij}$ to $- \\infty$ if there is no edge from $i$ to $j$ for the softmax calculation. We need to do this for all heads and the adjacency matrix is the same for each head. Use `tensor.masked_fill()` to mask $e_{ij}$ based on adjacency matrix for all heads. Hint: reshape the adjacency matrix to `[n_nodes, n_nodes, 1]` using `unsqueeze()`. \n","Now we are ready to normalize attention scores (or coefficients) $$\\alpha_{ij} = \\text{softmax}_j(e_{ij}) =  \\frac{\\exp(e_{ij})}{\\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\exp(e_{ik})}$$\n","\n","#### Apply dropout\n","Apply the dropout layer. (this step is easy)\n","\n","#### Calculate final output for each head\n","$$\\overrightarrow{h'^k_i} = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\alpha^k_{ij} \\overrightarrow{s^k_j}$$\n","\n","\n","#### Concat or Mean\n","Finally we concateneate the transformed features: $\\overrightarrow{h'_i} = \\Bigg\\Vert_{k=1}^{K} \\overrightarrow{h'^k_i}$. In the code, we only need to reshape the tensor to shape of `[n_nodes, n_heads * n_hidden]`. Note that if it is the final layer, then it doesn't make sense to do concatenation anymore. Instead, we sum over the `n_heads` dimension: $\\overrightarrow{h'_i} = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\overrightarrow{h'^k_i}$.
